3. Start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to the local server to see the application in action.

## Usage

Simply scroll down the page to see the boxes transition into view. Each box has a unique color and transition effect that activates when it comes into the viewport.

## Components

### `App.jsx`
The main component that orchestrates the display of animated boxes. It utilizes the `useObserverTransition` custom hook to manage the visibility of each box as it enters the viewport.

### `useObserverTransition.jsx`
A custom hook that leverages the Intersection Observer API to determine when an element is in view. It returns a reference for the element and a boolean indicating if it has transitioned.

## Styles

### `styles.module.css`
This file contains styles for the scroll animation and the boxes. The classes define the initial state and transition effects for each box.
